Instructions:

I have provided a list of several test users that must be used when running the "Delete register User from BrightTalk and check that the user is unable to log back into the platform"
Scenario. 

Once the second scenario is run, the test username/password no longer has the ability to
login to the Bright Talk platform.

Replace the |username|password| fields with the following (for Example). 
|username             |password             |
|deleteuser7@gmail.com|deleteuser7@gmail.com|
deleteuser8@gmail.com
deleteuser9@gmail.com
deleteuser10@gmail.com

For simplicity sake, I have made the username and password the same.

Running the Test....
1. You can run the test using the command line mvn test
2. Select TestRunnerFeatures.java right-click and run as a Junit test
3. Select BrightTalk.feature and run as a Cucumber feature

Having used both Firefox and Chrome browsers, I have settled with chrome.
Firefox versions 49.0.1/51.0.1 results were too inconsistent.
